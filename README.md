# Odoo Docker

## Getting Started

To start your Odoo instance, go to the directory of the docker-compose.yml file you created from the previous examples and type:

`$ docker-compose up -d`

Wait until the Docker installation is complete
And with that out of the way, open Odoo on localhost or at the following link http://localhost:8069
